## Controls
-------------
- The camera has Unity-like controls:
a.	While Right clicking: “WASD” fps-like movement, "QE" moves verticaly and with mouse movement you can look around.
b.	Mouse wheel zooms in and out.
c.	Alt+Left click orbits the object.
d.	Pressing “f” the camera focus around the geometry.
e.	Holding SHIFT duplicates movement and rotating speed.
f. Arrows also rotate the camera.

- FBX files and DDS textures can be drag & dropped from anywhere in the Hard Drive. 
The new geometry replaces the one on scene, the same for textures.
